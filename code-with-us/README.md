# Code With Us

**_Code With Us_** is a **procurement mechanism** for public sector organizations in British Columbia to pay developers for code.

_Code With Us_ speeds up the transaction between government and developer by using a two-in-one terms + contract. In the process of applying on an opportunity, developers agree to a set of terms and a fixed price contract for meeting stated acceptance criteria. 

_Code With Us_ opportunities are published on [bcdevexchange.org](https://bcdevexchange.org), where developers anywhere in the world can easily apply with a lightweight proposal on opportunities up to $70,000.
